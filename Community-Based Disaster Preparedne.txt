User Research:
Understanding Sarah and Aisha's motivations, goals, and needs will enable us to design inclusive features that cater to their requirements, fostering community preparedness and collaboration.

Two personas for the disaster preparedness app, representing two women from the same community with different backgrounds:

**1. Persona 1: Sarah Thompson (White, 32 years old)**

**Background:** Sarah is a 32-year-old white woman living in a suburban neighborhood in Cityville. She works as a marketing manager for a tech startup and has a busy schedule, often commuting to the city for work. She lives with her husband and two young children.

**Motivations and Goals:** Sarah's main goal is to ensure the safety and well-being of her family during emergencies. She worries about the potential risks of natural disasters like floods and earthquakes in their area. Due to her busy work life, she needs a convenient and user-friendly app that provides clear, actionable steps for disaster preparedness.

**Pain Points:** Sarah finds it challenging to stay updated on the latest disaster alerts and preparedness measures due to her packed schedule. She also worries about her children's safety when they are at school or daycare during an emergency.

**Needs from the App:** Sarah needs an app that sends real-time alerts to her phone, offering guidance on the best evacuation routes and nearby shelters. She wants the app to include family-specific checklists for emergency kits and personalized preparedness plans to cover her family's unique needs.

**2. Persona 2: Aisha Williams (Black, 27 years old)**

**Background:** Aisha is a 27-year-old Black woman living in the same suburban neighborhood as Sarah. She works as a nurse at the local hospital and is involved in community outreach programs. She lives with her partner, Marcus, who is a firefighter, and they have a pet dog.

**Motivations and Goals:** Aisha is passionate about helping others and being a reliable source of support during emergencies. As a frontline healthcare worker, she understands the importance of being well-prepared for disasters. She wants an app that fosters community communication and collaboration during crises.

**Pain Points:** Aisha is concerned about her neighbors' lack of disaster preparedness awareness. She knows that the community's response during emergencies can be more effective with better coordination. She also worries about her dog's safety during evacuations.

**Needs from the App:** Aisha needs an app that facilitates community engagement, enabling neighbors to share information, resources, and support during disasters. She would like to have a feature where neighbors can offer assistance to those who may need help evacuating their pets or securing their homes. Additionally, she wants the app to provide educational resources and training modules on disaster preparedness for community members.

This understanding will help them design features that cater to both Sarah and Aisha's requirements, making the app more inclusive and effective in promoting disaster preparedness within the community.
